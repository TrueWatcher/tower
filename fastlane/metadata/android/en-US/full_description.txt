<ul>
<li>no Google Services dependencies, only necessary permissions (fine and coarse location, internet, foreground service)</li>

<li>all waypoints are stored on a memory card and may be organized in any number of files (by regions etc.)</li>
<li>waypoint lists may be exported or imported in the GPX format, compatible with many navigators and software</li>
<li>finds location only by explicit user's command, so is very mild on the battery</li>
<li>capable of writing tracks (by means of a foreground service) and exporting them in the GPX format</li>
<li>tracks from other devices (GPX files) may be viewed along with your data</li>
<li>NOT implemented: map offline caching, routing, editing tracks, photo and video attachments, serving cold beer :)</li>
